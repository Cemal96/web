#Web development course

Welcome

Course will contain basic web knowleges, HTML, CSS, ... and students will decide what else(potentially Ruby, Python, JS(AngularJS or React or Ember...))

We plan to decrease the amount of the lecture in favor of collective discussion, team projects & collective work.
And give all power & responsibility to students.
All the materials will be in English.

During the test tasks kottans will learn:

1. Git, github basics, writing good commit messages
2. Command line basics
3. Deployment process (heroku, digital ...)
4. HTML, CSS basics
5. Ruby/Python basics
6. pip, rvm, nvm, npm
7. TDD, BDD - to get familiar with
8. Basic FP vocabulary, OOP patterns vocabulary
9. Web basics (HTTP/protocols, ssh, dns, etc)
10. ...


When you finish this task you can start the next one:
[Test 1](https://github.com/Kottans/web/blob/master/README01.md)

## P.S.

If you are willing to take a part of it you need to understand that you’ll spend a lot of time on building something big together - a new way of learning and collaborating. You’ll become a part of the small family and be ready to get a new friends and invest in this friendship a lot as in any friendship should be.
Final part of this course will be to split a parts and create news courses like that(and we’ll never stop).
