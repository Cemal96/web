#### P.S. If you are willing to take a part of it you need to understand that you’ll spend a lot of time on building something big together - a new way of learning and collaborating. You’ll become a part of the small family and be ready to get a new friends and invest in this friendship a lot as in any friendship should be. Final part of this course will be to split a parts and create news courses like that(and we’ll never stop).
